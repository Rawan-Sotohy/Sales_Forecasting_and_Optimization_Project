# Sales Forecasting and Optimization

This project is our graduation project from the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI). It focuses on predicting future sales and extracting actionable business insights using machine learning and data visualization tools.

## Overview

We developed a machine learning solution to predict sales and help businesses make data-driven decisions. The system includes an interactive web app, analytical dashboards, and optimization strategies based on historical data.

## Features

- Sales Forecasting: Predicts future sales using machine learning based on inputs like region, product type, and shipping date.
- Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes performance metrics using Plotly (in-app) and Power BI (external).
- Deployed Web App: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Optimization Insights: Recommends improvements based on performance trends and model predictions.

## Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Model Building (Random Forest Regressor)  
4. Model Evaluation & Tuning  
5. Deployment via Streamlit  
6. Dashboard Creation using Power BI

## Technologies Used
